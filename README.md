GZDoom

GZDoom version g3.7.2_legacy was used for compatibility and other customization purposes.

WADsmoosh

Utilizing WADsmoosh, a custom WAD is used containing all original levels including SIGIL.

Project Brutality

An older test version of Project Brutality is used due to the changes of the movement system from this build onward.
Newer builds have a new movement system in place that removes the original "feel," such as tilting when strafing.
