## Mods:

### [Full Run](https://jp.itch.io/doom-fullrun)
Allows player to play a "full run" of all 171 maps in all id releases as a single campaign.

### [Project Brutality](https://github.com/pa1nki113r/Project_Brutality)  |  [2018-01-21](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aRFCJeXDpjTxqYUgz_kNaLjkLVS9I6cK/view)
An older test version of Project Brutality is used due to the changes of the movement system from this build onward.

Newer builds have a new movement system in place that removes the original "feel," such as tilting when strafing.

### [UDV (Ultimate Doom Visor)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/doomvisor-hud-for-pa1nki113r-v51)  |  [v2.12b](https://mega.nz/folder/ABcWTZzD#urYIFclyyd75l2shnuiigw/file/5B8EGAxL)
Arguebly the best HUD for Project Brutality.

### [HOOVER1979 UltraHD Texture Pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/hoover1979-ultrahd-doom-texture-pack/downloads)  |  [Demo 2 (1K Version)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/hoover1979-ultrahd-doom-texture-pack/downloads/hoover1979-ultrahd-texture-pack-1k-version)
HOOVER1979 created beautifully new 4K textures for all the DOOM episodes.

However, the 1K version was used due to performance related issues when loading textures "on the fly."

He is contantly updating and share new textures over on his [DeviantArt page](https://www.deviantart.com/hoover1979/gallery/59360732/ultrahd-doom-texture-work).


### [DHTP (Doom High Resolution Texture Project)](https://github.com/KuriKai/DHTP)  |  [2019-11-17](https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-hd1/downloads/gzdoom-hd-texture-pack1)
Some textures that were not remade in HOOVER1979's texture pack were used. [Forum page](https://talk.dengine.net/discussion/875/dhtp-doom-high-resolution-texture-project)

### [Alternative HD Texture Pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-hd1/downloads/gzdoom-alternative-hd-texture-pack1)

From the [forum page](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/99021-doom-neural-upscale-2x-v-10/):
> Using AI NeuralNetworks, all textures and sprites have been upscaled 8x, then downscaled to a final 2X to restore a pixel art look.

Some of these upscaled sprites were used, while others were not due to some issues and conflicts (mostly from sprites of Project Brutality).
