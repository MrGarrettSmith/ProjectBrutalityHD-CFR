Allows player to play a "full run" of all 171 maps in all id releases as a single campaign.

## Project Brutality

An older test version of Project Brutality is used due to the changes of the movement system from this build onward.
Newer builds have a new movement system in place that removes the original "feel," such as tilting when strafing.
